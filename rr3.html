<h2>A website can be looked at as luggage. The aesthetic of the luggage can be the aesthetic of the website. For example, if you have a brand name luggage, your website would be well designed an elegant compared to a random luggage from Walmart or so. The things inside the luggage would be the contents of the website. Luggages also travel all around the world and so do websites, you can send them anywhere with a link.</h2>
