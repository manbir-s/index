	<h2>What do you think is Lialina’s opinion of the word “user”?</h2>

	<p>Lialina says that replacing the word user for people can be dangerous as it “hides the existence of two classes of people — developers and users.”. If the word users is to be replaced by people, users may lose their rights. Don Norman wants to eliminate the word user and replace it with the word people as he wants to make interaction seem invisible, as they are trying to make computers invisible. Lialina’s opinion is the opposite as she says that the word “user” is the last reminder we have that we’re using a computer.</p>

	<h2>What is Lialina’s ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</h2>

	<p>Lialina’s ideal internet user is “The General Purpose User/Universal Users/Turing Complete Users. Lialina says that these users “have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device. Such users will find a way to their aspiration without an app or utility programmed specifically for it.”. She gives examples of what a Universal User is, “General Purpose Users can write an article in their e-mail client, layout their business card in Excel and shave in front of a web cam. They can also find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook, make a black frame around pictures without instagram, remove a black frame from an instagram picture and even wake up at 7:00 without a “wake up at 7:00” app.”.</p>

	<h2>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users”?</h2>

	<p>An example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users” are social media websites. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and such have a code of displaying posts and have algorithms of what related posts to show and when to show them and codes for “liking” and “reposting” content. The gaps that users fill are by posting content themselves, “where smoothness and seamlessness are broken and some of the final links in the chain are left for the users to complete.”.</p>

<h2>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</h2>

<p>Seu is asking the reader to “defamiliarize our tools” because we use technology without thinking about anything. I think she is trying to tell the readers that this technology is more than just technology and how these things can be expressive. For example, a mouse is looked as just a device that lets you navigate through the computer screen but poetically the mouse/cursor is what takes you through different interactivities and different types of media, lets you explore the world (wide web).</p>

<h2>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</h2>

<p>One of the categories that I found interesting was Removing Function from Form. Which, in my words, it taking something and creating it for aesthetic reasons rather than functioning reasons. An example of taking function from form in car culture is taking a car and lowering it so much that it just gets stuck everywhere; on speed bumps, ramps, driveways, etc. One of the examples that Seu writes about that I really liked was Emilio Gomariz’s work called Ai Pro from 2012. Emilio uses tools from a software and covers up the expansion canvas, leaving use the canvas in the middle to work with. A website that shows form over function is http://papertoilet.com/. There is no purpose for this website, you just scroll the toilet paper away and that’s it.</p>

<h2>Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</h2>

<p>Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media because social media websites aren’t made for the user, that’s why there’s this sense of frustration while using their websites, as Schwulst says in her article. All these companies care about is how many people will use their websites and how much money they will get; “private companies that prioritize advertising above their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media.” (Schwulst, Laurel).
I agree with Schwulst because individual websites are much more interactive and comforting than other corporate websites. Individual websites are made with the sense of someone else is going to use this website, so maybe the coder designs the website in that way to help the user navigate through. Companies like Facebook just want you to be on their page for a long time so they can get more money. Individual websites tell a different story.</p>

<h2>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</h2>

<p>A website can be looked at as luggage. The aesthetic of the luggage can be the aesthetic of the website. For example, if you have a brand name luggage, your website would be well designed an elegant compared to a random luggage from Walmart or so. The things inside the luggage would be the contents of the website. Luggages also travel all around the world and so do websites, you can send them anywhere with a link.<p>
